## Process Guidance
Assuming you have printed the Medical Mindmap Paper Toolkit (or parts of it), you may cut all elements before modeling or just cut desired elements as needed.

The steps below outline the typical Medical Mindmapping process (but you may differ from it):

### Step 1
Start by **writing symptoms, therapies and other health factors** *(e.g. drugs, physical therapy, surgery, diet, activities and emotions)*, which are important to you, **on shapes**.

**Arrange the shape elements** on a plain sheet of paper or cardboard **and connect them using arrows**, which visually describe the relationship appropriately.

##### Hints:

 - You may change everything at any time *(e.g. arrangement, shapes, colors and sizes)*.
 - You can freely choose the visual representation of your elements regarding their properties *(e.g. color, shape, size)*.
 - Decide on a logical structure to give the different properties a meaning and keep it.
 - At first, concentrate on aspects that are clear and easy for you *(e.g. a shape and color for your main symptoms)* and go into detail from there.
 - You may cut your own shapes or differ the stencils as desired.
 - Think about how the elements relate to each other and select arrows representing these relationships in a suitable way.

### Step 2
Now that you got a first structure, you may **play with the arrangement and add further information** to it.

When you are happy with your arrangement, you should **fix the elements** with some adhesive paste *(you may glue it, but adhesive paste allows easy moving and removing of elements later on)*.

##### Hints:

 - There is a number of symbols included in this Paper Toolkit to add further details to your Mindmap, but you may also create your own or new symbols.
 - All information for which you can not find a visual representation, but
is important to you, you can write it on paper snippets and fix them next to the corresponding elements.

### Step 3
Now it's time to **create a legend** to explain (and store) the meaning of your chosen arrows, shapes, colors and symbols.

You should use the provided **legend template** *(available in [English](../master/print/ptk-legend-english_-_medical-mindmap-paper-toolkit_-_openmediaid.pdf) and [German](../master/print/ptk-legende-deutsch_-_medical-mindmap-paper-toolkit_-_openmediaid.pdf))*, which makes Medical Mindmaps more consistent and comparable.
